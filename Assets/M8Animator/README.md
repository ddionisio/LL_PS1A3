MateAnimator
============

Animator++

Based on: https://github.com/absameen/Animator_Timeline

Now remade to use DOTween: http://dotween.demigiant.com/index.php

This takes advantage of Sequence and the ability to cache all the tweens at startup. This allows the Animator to be used in critical parts of the game.

Also, Animator is no longer global and can be added to any game object.  You can now have many Sequences running simultaneously.

Mega Morph has been removed.

Import/Export, Code Generator are currently disabled. 

### Dependencies ###
* DOTween v1.1.310


Updates
=======
* Added DOTWEEN_HYPER_COMPATIBLE define symbol when using DOTWeen Hyper Compatible version, make sure to add this symbol in the player settings.
* Added dynamic expanding of frames in the timeline.  Number of frames is no longer configurable.  Can be configured in Options
* Changed how "Loop back to frame" works, requires loop count < 0.
* Added "End frame padding", allows for delay at the end.
* Converted to use DOTween
* Unity 5 compatibility.


Installation
============
* Make sure to get DOTween and install to your project: http://dotween.demigiant.com/download.php
  * If you are using the Hyper Compatible version, make sure to add DOTWEEN_HYPER_COMPATIBLE in the player settings
  * Go to Edit->Project Settings->Player
  * Add **DOTWEEN_HYPER_COMPATIBLE** in Scripting Define Symbols
* Clone this project to your Assets folder (or Plugins if you are scripting in javascript).  If your project is already setup for Git, then clone this project as a submodule.
* Open your project, you should be able to see "Cutscene Editor" in the Window menu, or M8/Animator in the 'Add Component' droplist.

TODO
====
* Find a way to use serialization for tracks to remove the need for component.
* Unify pathing of position track to all other tracks.
* Alternate Meta by using ID component (easier, less human error, but with a little bit more overhead)
* Allow typing of function for SendMessage event key.
* Import/Export - AnimatorMeta sort of does this already, but adding a JSON format wouldn't hurt.
* Add a way to make this tool extensive - will help with implementing tk2d, etc.
* Work with MechAnim. - allow change state, etc. and preview.
* Work with Particles - allow play/pause/stop and preview.
* Scene preview for Material property track.
* Any other glitches with mouse events.
* Camera transition fixes (too glitchy, maybe do something like UE4's director)

DEBUG
=====
Add "MATE\_DEBUG_ANIMATOR" (without quotes) in Player Settings -> Scripting Define Symbols.

For now it only shows a trace message whenever the GameObject "_animdata" is destroyed.
